# Welcome 👋

Hi, I am Pablo Origlia an electronic technician. I like so much build real world problem solutions through the programming algorithms and hardware design to it.

My main background is electronic, I have wide experience in instrumentation, measurement and control on automate non destructived test inspections at Energy Industry.

Although in my professional day-by-day I have been always in touch with programming issues a couple years ago, I seeked deep increase my knowledge in programming, analitical logical thinking oriented to solve problems that is why started my studies into degree in computer science.

Nowadays I am being able to reassemble my inner mental construtions about the basis programming concepts and sometimes no so basis. All it brought me to powerup my workflow and the quality of the piece of code tailored for the particular scenario.

Also I am interesting into the educational aspect of the technological and the basis principles that involved it.
